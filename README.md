# Yumi Kuchiki Bot

Yumi Kuchiki Bot is an open-source bot that runs on `discordJS`. This bot is currently to help me understand `JSON`, `Libs`, and `Frameworks`.

Originally this bot was for normal commands. However, with Discord switching to `Slash Commands` I think it was time to finally take the initiative and learn while also showing off my skills and work.

I have always been fond of the idea `Open-Source` and I am glad that it is possible to wright & publish code for free with no restrictions.

# Installation

Download the `.zip` file in [releases](example.com).  
Then find the `.env` file and replace the string with your bot application token.

You will need to change a couple lines of text in the program for `clientId` and `guildId`. For these you must have `Developer Mode` on and right click the bot and `Copy ID` and do the same to the guild and `Copy ID`.

Now everything should be done. You can add commands or delete them and change the bot to accept both `slash` and `prefix` commands in the `bot.js` file.
